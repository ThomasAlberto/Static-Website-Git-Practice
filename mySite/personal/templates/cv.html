  <h1>Bio</h1>
  <p>Hello, my name is Tom. I am a former Philosophy doctoral student who decided to change his career path into software engineering. If I want to sound interesting, I say I study "computer alchemy".</p>
  <p>My passions are in philosophy, programming, and Brazilian JiuJitsu.</p>
  <p>The reason I set out to do software engineering as a career is because I believe there is really no better skill for quickly scaling a project onto the deployment phase as a leader involved in the tech and business side. That is a hugely motivating freedom that this skillset fosters.</p>
  <p>If you would like to contact me about any of these things, you can reach me with these details:</p>
